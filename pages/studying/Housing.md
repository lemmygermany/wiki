# Housing

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**This page contains information on the housing options students usually have in Germany, and how to sign up for them.**

&nbsp;

## Student Housing

Less than 10% of German students live in dedicated student accommodation, which is organized by the [Studentenwerk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Studentenwerk) Germany's student services. There is one for each region. [Go to their website](http://www.studentenwerke.de/en) to find the one that is present at your university.

German student dorms have no security guards and no rules that would restrict your usage of alcohol, bringing guests of the opposite sex into your room, or whatever else. You are treated like an adult who is fully responsible for what you do with your life.

## Normal housing

The majority of German students live in "normal" flats, often shared with others ("Wohngemeinschaften", or "WGs"), which they rent on the open market. In some large cities, the demand for such flats is very high, so it can be quite a challenge to find housing. Take a look at [the wiki page on finding housing in Germany](https://www.reddit.com/r/germany/wiki/living/housing) for more help.
