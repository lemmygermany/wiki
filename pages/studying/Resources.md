## List of Resources

Name | Description
---|---
[ANABIN database](http://anabin.kmk.org/anabin-datenbank.html) | German only. Database to find out whether your high school diploma allows you to study in Germany or not. For most countries, there is also an [English version set up by DAAD](https://www2.daad.de/deutschland/nach-deutschland/voraussetzungen/en/57293-database-on-admission-requirements/).
[DAAD - Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst](https://www.daad.de/en/)  | German Academic Exchange Service. The DAAD is an association of German institutions of higher education and their student bodies. Contains a lot of information on studying in Germany, international programmes and a very good scholarship database.
[Uni-Assist](http://www.uni-assist.de/index_en.html) | University application service for international students (not all universities use this).
http://studentenwerke.de/en | German National Association for Student Affairs. Lots of useful information on studying in Germany in general, as well as information on student housing and finances (BAFÃ¶G).
[International Studierende](http://www.internationale-studierende.de/en/) | Website with infos for international students.
[Study in Germany (study-in.de)](https://www.study-in.de/en/)| By the DAAD. Has a search tool for universities and programmes. Authentic image about life and study in Germany. The editors are putting a lot of effort into their articles to make you imagine what Germany is really like. And who could do any better than our editors who are currently studying at German universities!
[Higher Education Compass](https://www.hochschulkompass.de/en/study-in-germany.html) | In-depth search tool for universities and programmes. Information is provided directly by the universities.
www.studienwahl.de| In-depth search tool for universities and programmes. On a similar level to the Higher Education Compass.

https://ranking.zeit.de/che/en/ | Requires registration. It's the only  ranking that compares German universities in a qualitatively good way. Comparing german universities by anglo-american standards where universities operate different doesn't make much sense and leads to skewed results. 250.000 students are questioned to compose the results. (for methodology see [che-ranking.de](http://www.che-ranking.de))
