# Finding a Job

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**This page contains a list of popular job websites and tips on how to find a job.** 

&nbsp;

## General Advice

### Job Advice

- Mind that certain companies might advertise new jobs via their internal system, rather than an agency or an external website. That means you should visit (and set up automatic alerts) both for job sites (see below) as well as potential employers' websites. 
- You can also check your local newspaper for jobs. 
- It is also possible to just send applications speculatively; it cannot really harm to do that. The HR department of the company might even store the application and call you back at a later time when a suitable position is open. 
- Reformat your CV to conform to the expectations of German employers. You can use the search engine of your choice to find templates and advice ([example from Monster.de](https://www.monster.de/karriereberatung/artikel/antworten-zum-lebenslauf)), but broadly: don't make it longer than two pages, add a photo, don't spend too much time on "personal interests", and write it in German if possible (unless the company specifically requests an English CV).  

### Internship Advice
There are two kinds of internships. Paid internships and unpaid internships, both with legal definitions behind them.

- Unpaid internships: To clarify, unpaid internships, often called "Praktikum", still allow for you to be paid money, although the amount will not be big.  Unpaid internships are for people who are required to take an internship as part of their Undergraduate degree or Graduate degree. Depending on your degree and its requirements, you have to take practical work in your field via an internship. Some Graduate degree require having an internship under your belt in order to qualify for the graduate program, however this is different for every school as well as program. A qualified internship can give you an extra 30 ETCS points towards your requirements to qualify for a masters program. These internships state that they require the intern to be a full time student. This is due to the fact Germany has implemented a minimum wage and having this requirement gives a company a way to pay the intern not as much or anything at all. Also to complete a masters degree, you might be required to complete an Internship, and this would be the type of internship you would probably receive. 
- Paid Internships: Paid internships are internships that you go for when you have a degree in hand and hope to get a foot in the door and land a decent job. The employer has to pay at least 8.50€ per hour if the internship lasts longer than 3 months. That being said, you can still go after an "Unpaid" internship, the caveat being the employer has to pay you. So while it won't hurt to file an application, especially if it is with a company where you have a profile with your CV, and other things on it already, the may not want to hire you because they are required to pay you minimum wage and is probably less likely to lead to a full time job.
