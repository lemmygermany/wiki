## DHL delivery rerouted

**I've received a notification that my packet was rerouted to a branch ("Filiale") of the post office!**  

If you are not able to go to the branch and pick up your packet, you can order a redelivery!  

Under http://www.dhl.de/nochmal-zustellen (German language, use a translator)   

you can order DHL to resend your package from a branch or from a packet locker (Packstation)


## Customs fees when ordering from abroad  

**If you order stuff from outside the EU, German VAT and possible customs duties will be leveraged**. Beware:  

You pay at the least 19% VAT ("Einfuhrumsatzsteuer") on imported goods AND (!) the shipping costs. Depending on the value and the ordered objects you might also have to pay customs fees between 1.5 and 5%, sometimes more.  

If you have not registered with customs as a "Selbstverzoller" (meaning you will go to customs and pick up your delivery and pay the duties in their office) DHL will collect upon delivery at your door, applying a surcharge of 6â‚¬ for this service.
